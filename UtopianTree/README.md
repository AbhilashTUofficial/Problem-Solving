# Utopian Tree
The Utopian Tree goes through 2 cycles of growth every year. Each spring, it doubles in height. Each summer, its height increases by 1 meter.

A Utopian Tree sapling with a height of 1 meter is planted at the onset of spring. How tall will the tree be after n growth cycles?

For example, if the number of growth cycles is n = 5, the calculations are as follows:
    Period  Height
    0       1
    1       2
    2       3
    3       6
    4       7
    5       14

### Function Description
utopianTree has the following parameter:
* int n: the number of growth cycles to simulate

### Returns
* int: the height of the tree after the given number of cycles

### Sample Input
    3
    0
    1
    4

### Sample Output
    1
    2
    7
